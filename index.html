Privacy Policy for PawHab


Thank you for using PawHab (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use the App.

If you do not agree with this policy, please do not use the App.

1. Summary
- We process your pet photos to analyze behavior and provide guidance.
- Photos are sent securely to Google’s Generative AI services (Gemini API via Google AI Studio) for analysis.
- We do not sell your data.
- We do not use your images to train AI models; they are used only to generate results.
- You can delete locally stored data at any time by clearing the App’s cache/storage.

2. Data We Collect
2.1 Photos and Media You Provide
- When you choose an image from your gallery or capture one with your camera, the App temporarily accesses that image to perform analysis.
- Images may be transmitted to a third-party AI service (Google Gemini) exclusively to generate the analysis results.

2.2 Device and Usage Data (App-internal)
- Basic app diagnostics and error information may be collected locally to ensure functionality (e.g., crash or error messages). This is not linked to your identity.
- This data is not transmitted externally and remains only on your device.

2.3 No Account or Personal Identifiers
- The App does not require account creation or collect personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email, or phone number by default.

3. How We Use Your Data
- To analyze the selected photo and generate behavior insights for dogs, cats, birds, or fish.
- To improve functionality, performance, and user experience (e.g., troubleshooting issues).

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
- We share the selected image with Google’s Generative Language (Gemini) API strictly for the purpose of generating the analysis result.
- We do not sell your data.
- We may disclose information if required by law or to protect our legal rights.

5. Third-Party Services
- The App uses Google’s Generative Language API (Gemini) to process images and text.
- Your use of the App may be subject to Google’s terms and privacy policy:
  - Google Privacy Policy: https://policies.google.com/privacy
  - Google AI Safety and Terms may also apply.

6. Data Retention
- Photos are processed on demand. The App does not permanently store your photos on our servers.
- The App does not upload or store any data on developer-owned servers.
- Temporary local files (e.g., cached images) may be stored on your device and can be deleted by clearing the App’s cache/storage.
- Third-party retention: Google may temporarily process or store data per its own policies. Please review Google’s documentation for details.

7. Security
- We use HTTPS to transmit data to third-party APIs.
- We take reasonable measures to safeguard data in transit and within the App; however, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

8. Children’s Privacy
- The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has provided images or data through the App, please contact us to request deletion.

9. Your Choices and Controls
- You can stop using the App at any time.
- You can clear the App’s cache/storage to remove locally stored data.
- You can deny or revoke permissions (e.g., Camera) through your device settings; this may limit functionality.

10. Permissions Used
- Camera (android.permission.CAMERA): to capture pet photos for analysis.
- Internet (android.permission.INTERNET): to connect securely to the analysis service (Google Gemini).

Note: On modern Android versions, selecting images from the gallery is handled by the system picker; the App does not require broad storage permissions for this operation.

11. International Transfers
- Processing may occur on Google servers located globally. Data may be processed by third-party services on servers located in other countries. By using the App, you consent to such transfers as necessary to provide the service.
- In some regions, alternative AI processing may be used if Google services are unavailable.

12. Changes to This Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected by the “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
